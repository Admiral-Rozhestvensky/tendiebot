# TendieBot
this repo exists because im too lazy to manually move files

for all my boys coming from the discord, you can suggest additions/changes to the pull requests thingy.
if it looks good and doesn't give unreasonable power to people ill probably add it.
PLEASE TEST YOUR OWN CODE. create a test bot or something, just dont submit a command that will break the bot.

Dependancies:  
NodeJS v9.3.0  
  
Discord.js v11.3.0  
Discord.js Commando v0.9.0  
Node-Persist v2.1.0

The code will refrence the folder `./storage/` and the file `settings.json`. `./storage/` contains all the user-specific things that get stored (like !put/!get data) and `settings.json` contains private information or things I didn't want to hardcode (like the bot's token)

if you need any help with things, just ask me
